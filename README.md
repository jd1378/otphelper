# COPY SMS CODE | OTP Helper | کپی رمز پیامک

An open-source application that allows you to copy OTP and codes from SMS and notifications automatically by reading all of your notifications.

or get the APK from [Latest Release](https://github.com/jd1378/otphelper/releases/latest).

## How it works

The app setups a [notification listener](https://github.com/jd1378/otphelper/blob/main/app/src/main/java/io/github/jd1378/otphelper/NotificationListener.kt) and reads all notifications that is sent by any apps. So the name of the app is a bit inaccurate. This allows the app to detect codes also from emails and possibly any other app that sends notification.
when a notification is sent, the app creates a single string from all text in the notification, then [checks if it should be ignored](https://github.com/jd1378/otphelper/blob/main/app/src/main/java/io/github/jd1378/otphelper/utils/CodeIgnore.kt). If It's not ignored, then It's matched against the [code detection regex](https://github.com/jd1378/otphelper/blob/main/app/src/main/java/io/github/jd1378/otphelper/utils/CodeExtractor.kt). Then app will take the extracted code and behave according to settings.

## How to build

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
